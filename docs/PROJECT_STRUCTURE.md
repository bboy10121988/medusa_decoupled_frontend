# Project Structure Organization - Summary

## Overview
This document provides an overview of the project structure optimization completed to improve maintainability and organization.

## Changes Made

### 1. Documentation Organization
All documentation has been moved from the root directory into a structured `docs/` folder:

```
docs/
├── README.md                   # Documentation overview
├── architecture/               # Technical architecture docs
│   ├── ARCHITECTURE.md        # GrapesJS architecture guide  
│   └── REFACTOR_PLAN.md       # Refactoring plan
├── components/                 # Component library docs
│   └── COMPONENT-LIBRARY-GUIDE.md
├── fixes/                      # Bug fix reports
│   ├── BOOTSTRAP_*.md         # Bootstrap related fixes
│   ├── FULLSCREEN_*.md        # Fullscreen fixes
│   └── SIDEBAR_*.md           # Sidebar fixes
└── guides/                     # User guides
    ├── GRAPESJS-HOME-MODULES-GUIDE.md
    ├── GRAPESJS-SANITY-INTEGRATION.md
    └── GRAPESJS-TRAITS-GUIDE.md
```

### 2. Component Structure Reorganization
Components have been organized into logical groups:

```
src/components/
├── ui/                         # UI utility components
│   ├── ConditionalRoot.tsx
│   ├── ConditionalStyles.tsx
│   ├── ConditionalTheme.tsx
│   └── ConditionalTheme-simple.tsx
└── cms/                        # CMS related components
    ├── grapesjs/              # GrapesJS editor components
    │   ├── styles/            # Organized CSS files
    │   ├── config/            # Configuration files
    │   ├── custom-components/ # Custom components
    │   ├── i18n/              # Internationalization
    │   ├── plugins/           # Plugin files
    │   └── *.tsx              # Main components
    └── sanity/                # Sanity CMS components
        └── GrapesJSInput.tsx
```

### 3. Cleanup Actions
- ✅ Removed backup files (.bak)
- ✅ Removed empty documentation files
- ✅ Removed unused/incomplete components:
  - `main-section` (empty)
  - `youtube-section` folder (empty, kept .tsx file)
  - `featured-products-block` (unused)
- ✅ Cleaned up empty JSON files
- ✅ Organized data files into `data/` folder

### 4. Import Path Updates
All import paths have been updated to reflect the new structure:
- `@/components/grapesjs/*` → `@/components/cms/grapesjs/*`
- `@/components/sanity/*` → `@/components/cms/sanity/*`

### 5. Module Organization
Updated module exports in `src/modules/home/index.ts` to remove unused components and improve clarity.

## Benefits
1. **Better Maintainability**: Logical grouping makes it easier to find and maintain components
2. **Cleaner Root Directory**: No more scattered documentation files
3. **Natural Language Structure**: Folder names are intuitive and follow common conventions
4. **Reduced Clutter**: Removed incomplete/deprecated functionality
5. **Consistent Organization**: Similar components are grouped together

## Components Status
All active components are working and tested:
- ✅ Hero/HeroSection - working
- ✅ ImageTextBlock - working with all layouts
- ✅ FeaturedProducts - working  
- ✅ ServiceCardsSection - working
- ✅ YoutubeSection - working
- ✅ ContentSection - working
- ✅ GrapesJS Editor - working with updated paths

## Future Maintenance
- Use `src/components/ui/` for general UI components
- Use `src/components/cms/` for CMS-specific components
- Add new documentation to appropriate `docs/` subfolder
- Use `.temp/` folder for temporary development files
- Follow the established naming conventions
